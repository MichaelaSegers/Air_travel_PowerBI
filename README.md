Number of passengers by country where air carrier is registered.

Data for flight passengers come from https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.PSGR

Some data entries are estimates and sometimes, data entries for specific years and countries are missing - this influences the sum of all passengers over monitored period for these countries.

For population info, data from https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL are used.
